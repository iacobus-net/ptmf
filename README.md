Power Transport Multicast Framework (PTMF) is a FREE framework for developing portable Java reliable, semireliable and unreliable multicast applications.


#Origin
PTMF is initialy based on a novel reliable multicast transport protocol (level 4 of the OSI stack) developed at Universidad de Sevilla. PTMF has been implemented with a herarchical design based on local groups that help minimizing control flow and permit the grow of the numbers of participants to a high level.

#Target
Provide a usefull framework to easy develop multicast applications.
PTMF is been designed to be used to implement Scada Multicast on SmartGrids.
At present test applications are using IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. 
New protocol IEC 61850 could be used too.
